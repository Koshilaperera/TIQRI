﻿# SauceDemoAutomation

Automates the end-to-end checkout flow on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) using Selenium, SpecFlow, and NUnit (.NET 8). 
To set up, clone the repository, restore NuGet packages, and open it in Visual Studio or VS Code. 
Ensure Chrome is installed. Run tests via Visual Studio Test Explorer or `dotnet test`. Tests use `standard_user` credentials, include explicit waits to prevent flakiness, and each scenario opens and closes a browser instance using Hooks.


## Version Control & CI

- Hosted on GitHub. Contributors: gtsameeta, nadunstain  
- Continuous Integration (CI) is set up via **GitHub Actions**. Tests run automatically on push or pull request using `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
